Dindigul, a city and the administrative headquarters of the district bearing its name in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, boasts a rich tapestry of history, industry, and culture. Its name is derived from the Tamil words thindu (pillow) and kal (rock), referring to the distinctive, pillow-shaped Rock Fort that dominates the city skyline and serves as a major historical landmark . This fort's strategic location was pivotal, marking the border of the ancient Pandyas, Cheras, and Cholas kingdoms. Over centuries, Dindigul was ruled by numerous dynasties, including the Madurai Nayaks, the Kingdom of Mysore under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, and eventually the British, making the fort a silent witness to countless conflicts and power shifts.<br></br><br></br>

Beyond its historical significance, Dindigul is renowned as a hub for several niche industries. It is famously known as the 'City of Locks', associated for a long time with the manufacturing of high-quality, durable iron locks and safes. This traditional skill even earned the Dindigul locks a Geographical Indication (GI) tag. The district is also a major centre for the leather tanning industry and is recognized for its textile and handloom sectors, with places like Chinnalapatti being famous for Art-Silk and Sungudi sarees.Agriculture remains a fundamental part of the district's economy. Dindigul is a major wholesale market for crops like onion and groundnut, and the conducive climate supports horticulture, producing cash crops like coffee, flowers, and fruits. The town of Oddanchatram, within the district, is particularly noted as a major vegetable market. The historical association with tobacco is also strong; during the British era, Dindigul was a key centre for cigar manufacture, including the famous 'Light of Asia' cigar.
